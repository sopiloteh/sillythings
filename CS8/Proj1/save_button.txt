A save feature. More or less a button that allows you to save between scanning in  new orders, editing a basic or premier users data.

Feature: Save Button
As a user, I want the ability to save when I want to so I don't loose my work.

Acceptance Criteria:
- exiting without saving should prompt user to save
- saving shows a saved dialog
- clicking save, overwrites old data. It does not keep anything old as is it is overwritten with new data. 
- user can see save time

Definition of done:
The user will click a save button on any edit screen that the user is currently in. From top of head I can think of scanning in sales orders, adding orders, adding a new guest to basic or premier rewards membership. Updating a user to premier or downgrading a user to basic. Once save button is clicked, a new dialog will appear that says saved along with time and date. There should also be a saved dialog that shows save history. User saved at this time, etc.

Tasks:
- implement a gui to create a save button
- implement a class to save data to assigned array

Tests:
-exit without saving
- repeatedly save and check data integrity
- make massive edits and save to see if save button logic can cater to big data
