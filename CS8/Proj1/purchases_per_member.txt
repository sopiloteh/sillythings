A user should be able to enter a membership number or name and get a list of the total purchases per that member.

Feature: Total Purchases Per Member Report
As a user, I want to be able to access a purchases report for any particular member.

Acceptance criteria:
- Report should include all purchases a member has made.
- Report should allow for input of either a membership number, or name.

Definition of done:
The user should be able to request for the member's purchases report by clicking a button on the GUI. Then, a window should pop up containing the information listed in the acceptance criteria. The application should remain stable and properly responsive as the user manipulates the View.

Tasks:
- implement the save class
- implement a class to tally up purchases in an array
- implement a gui to show purchases made per member
- implement/inheritance to rewards class

Tests:
- Clicking the purchases report button should print the member sales report with the promised information in the right order.
- If there is no member found for the requested ID, then the report should be empty and should say to the user that there was no member found.
