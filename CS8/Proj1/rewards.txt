As a user who shops, I want to be reward like a guinea pig to shop at Costco.

Acceptance criteria:
- there should be a single track to a rewards path, it will allow all users to have rewards.
- basic users will have rewards at certain levels, premier users will get those same rewards in addition to getting incremental rewards in between.
- premier users will also have special double earning days to get rewards faster. 
- rewards will only go out to active users, not expired users.

Definition of done:
A sales report can be run to show that a certain user has earned enough to gain a reward. This reward will then be added to the sales receipt of that said user and then saved in history.

Tasks:
-implement a class to assign points
-implement a class/array to  save points
-implement the above array to print out rewards at certain levels
-implement/inheritance to allow basic and premier memberships to gain different rewards via a class

Tests:
- premier members should always have more reward levels then basic users
- both premier and basic users should be able to earn the same level rewards
- basic users can only get level rewards, not increments
- point earning days should apply to premier members only
