This is what is needed for baselight and xyztech files

take the both files and pair them up with whatever frames they have
so if baselight has frames 9-100 and xyztech asks for frames 5-9 for author james cut them out and put them in an excel sheet
this excel sheet will be called the frames to fix. Ideally youll use argparse to insert the files and run the commands

secondly after the excel frames to fix is created, youll dump these files into and sql database
allow some read and write to see the tables

finally youll run the script against the twitch test video, find all the ranges inside the video then
using ffmpeg pull out the frames, youll want to convert the marks to timecode

add to your argparse an output parameter for a new xls file that will attach these frames to a sheet
with the name and the frame and requestor

finally youll output each frame to be rendered in frame.io  and youll be done!
