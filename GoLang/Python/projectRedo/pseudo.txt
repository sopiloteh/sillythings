this is psudeocode for the script project

we have two input files that we get
File A has all the filepaths of the shots that we are using
File B has all the frames and filepaths of shots, they arent catagorized

    inputA = file.xlsx, open as strings
    inputDumpA = inputA

the script should take in both files and put them into a storage type of file, this has to be the best one for python since it will be
mainly run in python

storage A should just store all the filepaths 
storage B should strip out file paths and the frame numbers, each frame number should be as such 100-105, 109-123 , 125, 190-211, etc

the script will then look at the file path thats in A then looking at B, see what paths/frames match up


these will be sorted into a storage array and a csv, this is section one

now section two will take that storage array and punch those locations and frames into a SQL database
for each item thats entered, it should have
  filepath
  frames
  editor
  what needs to be done if anything

the standard SQL commands should work like insert, delete, view onto the terminal prompt

once thats done thats the end of section 2

Section 3 wiil take all the info inside the SQL database and then run it thru FFMPEFG
it will run it using a test video, the video will only be a certain length the script should first find the timecode on the video

using this timecode then the script will match up frames to time code spots, anything that matches will be processed
FFMPEG will be run on the frames then exported out to an excel sheet

the excel sheet will have the same items as in Section 1 CSV but now with photos added in it

after all the items are written in the excel sheet, then all the frames will be rendered into frame.io 
once all this is done, the script should finish. 

This will be written in python using SQL, ffmnpeg hardware engine and some other API's
