Test Plan & User Guide

TestPlan
*******************************************************************************
Ideally if this program was working correctly, Id test it as such
For the batch file id load it up with a normal day use following banking hours, with a break for lunch for an hour where no classes would be full.

Then id throw some walk up requests that had higher priority events, such as lectures and have them be rather long, say around 120 minutes or more.
This would either overwrite the old batch files positions and leave new holes or it would
Just continue the same and say its not allowed.

Id also include some events that weren't in the hours of operation in the batch file and see how the program would handle it. If it worked great, it wouldn't even have them on the view schedule. If it was bad, then it wouldn't show any events at all even including walk up ones
